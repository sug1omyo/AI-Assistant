description: "Choose which repository skill to activate for a given task. Use when: starting any chatbot, MCP, config, or docs task to determine the best skill or skill combination; reviewing whether the right skills were applied; or deciding whether to combine multiple skills for a cross-cutting change."

# Skills Dispatch Map

## Purpose

This skill is a router. It tells you which of the 14 repository skills to activate for a given task. Read this **before** reading any other skill, so you pick the right one (or the right combination) on the first try.

## Default scope

All skills below target the **core chatbot and tools stack** — `services/chatbot/`, `services/mcp-server/`, `services/shared_env.py`, `app/config/`, `app/src/`. Do not apply these skills to ComfyUI, Stable Diffusion, or image pipeline work unless the task explicitly requires it.

**Line-number references:** Several skills cite specific line numbers (e.g., `stream.py` L258). These are approximate landmarks from when the skill was written. Search for the described content or function name rather than jumping to the exact line — the code evolves.

## Multi-skill escalation

Some tasks require 3+ skills. These are the most common multi-skill patterns:

### Pattern A: New feature end-to-end

**Example:** Add a new search tool with UI button, API key, and tests.

| Order | Skill | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 1 | search-tool-cascade | Tool function, fallback position |
| 2 | provider-env-matrix | New API key config |
| 3 | shared-env-contract | Env variable loading |
| 4 | tool-response-contract | Return shape |
| 5 | chat-ui-sync | UI button wiring |
| 6 | test-impact-mapper | Which tests to add/run |
| 7 | docs-drift-sync | README search tools table |

### Pattern B: New provider + model

**Example:** Add Anthropic provider with Claude model.

| Order | Skill | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 1 | provider-env-matrix | Model registry, API key |
| 2 | shared-env-contract | Env loading |
| 3 | core-chatbot-routing-audit | Provider routing in chatbot.py |
| 4 | chat-ui-sync | Model selector update |
| 5 | workflow-impact-guard | CI env assumptions |
| 6 | docs-drift-sync | README provider table |

### Pattern C: Dependency upgrade with CI impact

**Example:** Upgrade `openai` SDK major version.

| Order | Skill | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 1 | requirements-profile-selection | Profile classification |
| 2 | workflow-impact-guard | CI install impact |
| 3 | provider-env-matrix | API client changes |
| 4 | tool-response-contract | Response shape changes from new SDK |
| 5 | test-impact-mapper | Which tests cover affected code |

### Pattern D: Debug a CI failure

**Example:** Tests pass locally, fail in CI.

| Order | Skill | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 1 | workflow-impact-guard | Understand CI env and install steps |
| 2 | requirements-profile-selection | Missing package? |
| 3 | service-health-check-audit | Startup failure in CI? |
| 4 | shared-env-contract | Missing env var default? |

### Pattern E: New MCP tool with chatbot integration

**Example:** Add an MCP tool that the chatbot calls via proxy route.

| Order | Skill | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 1 | mcp-tool-authoring | Tool registration, response shape |
| 2 | core-chatbot-routing-audit | Chatbot-side MCP proxy route |
| 3 | tool-response-contract | Wire formats |
| 4 | chat-ui-sync | If UI exposes the tool |
| 5 | docs-drift-sync | MCP tool documentation |

## Dispatch decision tree

```
START → What is the primary object of the change?

├── Route / endpoint / blueprint  → core-chatbot-routing-audit
├── LLM provider / model / API key → provider-env-matrix
├── Search tool / reverse image   → search-tool-cascade
├── MCP tool / resource / prompt  → mcp-tool-authoring
├── Thinking mode / agentic pipe  → thinking-mode-routing
├── UI control / selector / render → chat-ui-sync
├── Env variable / .env loading   → shared-env-contract
├── Python package / requirements  → requirements-profile-selection
├── Startup / port / health        → service-health-check-audit
├── Log statement / error handler  → observability-log-hygiene
├── CI workflow / test runner      → workflow-impact-guard
├── Documentation / README         → docs-drift-sync
├── Test scope decision            → test-impact-mapper
└── Return shape / payload field   → tool-response-contract

THEN → Does the change cross into another domain?
  YES → Load the additional skill(s) from the routing matrix above.
  NO  → Proceed with the primary skill only.

FINALLY → Does the change affect runtime behavior?
  YES → Also load docs-drift-sync (for docs) + test-impact-mapper (for tests).
  NO  → Skip.
```

## Skills that are almost always secondary

These skills rarely lead a task but are frequently loaded alongside a primary skill:

| Skill | When to add as secondary |
|-------|-------------------------|
| **docs-drift-sync** | Any change to ports, commands, env vars, entry points, or service responsibilities |
| **test-impact-mapper** | Any code change that might affect test outcomes |
| **workflow-impact-guard** | Any change that adds dependencies, changes env, or modifies startup |
| **observability-log-hygiene** | Any change that adds error handling or touches exception paths |
| **tool-response-contract** | Any change that modifies what data flows from backend to frontend |

---

## Skills that should NOT be combined

| Combination | Why not |
|-------------|---------|
| Any chatbot skill + image pipeline work | Different venv, different services, different concerns. If the task is image-only, none of these 14 skills apply. |
| mcp-tool-authoring + thinking-mode-routing | MCP tools and thinking modes are independent systems. A change to one does not affect the other unless the task explicitly bridges them. |

## Dispatch checklist

Before starting any chatbot/core task:

- [ ] **Primary skill identified** — one skill that matches the main object of the change
- [ ] **Secondary skills checked** — routing matrix consulted for additional skills
- [ ] **Scope confirmed as core** — change does not require image pipeline skills
- [ ] **Multi-skill order planned** — if 3+ skills, read them in the order listed in the escalation patterns
- [ ] **docs-drift-sync considered** — does the change alter runtime behavior that docs describe?
- [ ] **test-impact-mapper considered** — does the change require running or adding tests?
- [ ] **workflow-impact-guard considered** — does the change affect CI assumptions?
