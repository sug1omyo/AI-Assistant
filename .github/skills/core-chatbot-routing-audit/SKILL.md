# Core Chatbot Routing Audit

## When to use this skill

- Adding, removing, or renaming a chatbot route or endpoint.
- Changing provider routing or model selection logic.
- Wiring a new tool (search, image, MCP) into the chat pipeline.
- Debugging broken SSE streaming or missing UI controls.
- Checking whether a Flask route has a FastAPI equivalent (or vice versa).
- Reviewing blueprint registration order or URL prefix conflicts.
- Verifying that a frontend JS call still matches its backend endpoint.

## Mandatory first step

**Trace the real request path before editing anything.** Identify:
1. Which entry point handles the request (Flask blueprint or FastAPI router).
2. Which core module processes it (chatbot.py, tools.py, thinking_generator.py).
3. Which UI element triggers it (template HTML, static JS module).
4. What response shape the frontend expects (JSON, SSE events, redirect).

## File map — likely touch points

### Entry points

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `services/chatbot/chatbot_main.py` | Flask monolith — registers blueprints, starts app |
| `services/chatbot/run.py` | Dispatcher — selects Flask legacy / Flask modular / FastAPI |
| `services/chatbot/fastapi_app/__init__.py` | FastAPI app factory — `create_app()`, includes routers |

### Flask blueprints — `services/chatbot/routes/`

| File | Blueprint | Key routes |

| `routes/async_routes.py` | `async_bp` | `/chat/async` — async SSE streaming |

### FastAPI routers — `services/chatbot/fastapi_app/routers/`

| File | Key routes |
|---|---|
| `routers/chat.py` | `POST /chat` — main chat handler, council mode, xAI native |
| `routers/stream.py` | `POST /chat/stream` — SSE streaming |
| `routers/conversations.py` | Conversation CRUD |

| `routers/rag.py` | RAG search |
| `routers/council_stream.py` | Multi-agent council streaming |
| `routers/xai_native_stream.py` | xAI native research streaming |

### Core logic — `services/chatbot/core/`

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `core/chatbot.py` | `ChatbotAgent.chat()` — provider dispatch, tool routing |
| `core/tools.py` | Tool implementations: `google_search_tool`, `serpapi_web_search`, `serpapi_reverse_image`, `serpapi_image_search`, `saucenao_search_tool`, `reverse_image_search` |
| `core/config.py` | All API keys and constants (read from env) |

### UI layer

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `templates/index.html` | Chat UI — fetch calls, EventSource, form submission |
| `static/js/modules/api-service.js` | Core API client — `sendMessage()`, `sendStreamMessage()` |
| `static/js/modules/image-gen-v2.js` | Image gen API calls |
| `static/js/mcp.js` | MCP panel API calls |
| `static/js/main.js` | Video gen, gallery, title gen, file extract calls |

---

## Provider routing — how model selection works

```
Client sends { model: "grok" | "openai" | "deepseek" | "qwen" | "gemini" | "<name>-local" }
  → ChatbotAgent.chat()
    → model == "grok"     → chat_with_grok()     [GROK_API_KEY, xAI API]
    → model == "openai"   → chat_with_openai()   [OPENAI_API_KEY]
    → model == "deepseek" → chat_with_deepseek()  [DEEPSEEK_API_KEY]
    → model == "qwen"     → chat_with_qwen()     [QWEN_API_KEY]
    → model == "gemini"   → chat_with_gemini()   [GOOGLE_API_KEY]
    → model.endswith("-local") → chat_with_local_model()
```

Default model: `grok` (configured in `core/config.py`).

---

## Tool dispatch — how tools are triggered

### Explicit tool selection (UI button → `tools` parameter)

| UI button | Tool ID | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 🔍 Web Search | `google-search` | `google_search_tool()` or `serpapi_web_search()` |
| Lens | `serpapi-reverse-image` | `serpapi_reverse_image()` → cascade |
| Bing | `serpapi-bing` | `serpapi_web_search(engine="bing")` |
| Baidu | `serpapi-baidu` | `serpapi_web_search(engine="baidu")` |
| Img Search | `serpapi-images` | `serpapi_image_search()` |
| SauceNAO | `saucenao` | `saucenao_search_tool()` |

### Auto-trigger (realtime keyword detection in `routes/stream.py`)

Vietnamese patterns: giá, tỷ giá, thời tiết, tin tức, hôm nay, bitcoin, vàng, chứng khoán…  
English patterns: price, weather, news, latest, today, stock, bitcoin, crypto, gold…

When detected → auto-injects `google_search_tool()` results into context.

### Search cascade order (do not break)

- **Web**: SerpAPI Google → SerpAPI Bing/Baidu → Google CSE fallback
- **Reverse image**: Google Lens → Google Reverse Image → Yandex

## SSE streaming contract

`POST /chat/stream` returns `text/event-stream` with these event types:

| Event | Payload | When |
|---|---|---|
| `thinking_start` | `{}` | Thinking mode activated |
| `thinking` | `{ content }` | Each thinking token/step |
| `thinking_end` | `{}` | Thinking complete |
| `chunk` | `{ content }` | Response text fragment |
| `complete` | `{ full_response, metadata }` | Final response + model info |
| `suggestions` | `{ suggestions: [...] }` | Follow-up suggestions |
| `error` | `{ error, message }` | Error occurred |

**Frontend contract**: `static/js/modules/api-service.js` → `sendStreamMessage()` parses these events. Changing event names or payload shapes **will break the UI**.

---

## UI-to-backend endpoint map

| JS call site | Method | URL | Backend handler |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api-service.js` | POST | `/chat` | `routes/main.py` or `routers/chat.py` |
| `api-service.js` | POST | `/chat/stream` | `routes/stream.py` or `routers/stream.py` |
| `api-service.js` | GET | `/chat/stream/models` | `routes/stream.py` |
| `main.js` | POST | `/api/generate-title` | `routes/main.py` |
| `main.js` | POST | `/api/extract-file-text` | `routes/main.py` |
| `main.js` | POST | `/api/video/generate` | `routes/main.py` or `routers/video.py` |
| `image-gen-v2.js` | POST | `/api/image-gen/generate` | `routes/image_gen.py` |
| `image-gen-v2.js` | GET | `/api/image-gen/gallery` | `routes/image_gen.py` |
| `image-gen-v2.js` | GET | `/api/image-gen/providers` | `routes/image_gen.py` |
| `mcp.js` | POST | `/api/mcp/enable` | `routes/mcp.py` |
| `mcp.js` | GET | `/api/mcp/list-files` | `routes/mcp.py` |
| `mcp.js` | POST | `/api/mcp/add-folder` | `routes/mcp.py` |
| `mcp.js` | POST | `/api/mcp/fetch-url` | `routes/mcp.py` |

## Monitor — what can silently break

1. **Blueprint registration order** — a new blueprint with an overlapping prefix can shadow existing routes.
2. **SSE event names** — renaming events (e.g. `chunk` → `token`) breaks `api-service.js` parsing.
3. **Response shape changes** — adding/removing keys in `complete` event payload can break UI rendering.
4. **Tool ID mismatch** — UI sends tool IDs from `index.html`; backend matches by string. A rename on either side silently disables the tool.
5. **Auto-search keyword lists** — adding/removing patterns in `routes/stream.py` changes when web search fires.
6. **Provider method signature** — changing params in `chat_with_grok()` etc. can break the dispatch in `ChatbotAgent.chat()`.
7. **Flask/FastAPI drift** — a route added to Flask but not FastAPI (or vice versa) creates mode-dependent behavior.
8. **Static file caching** — browser-cached JS may call old endpoints after a rename.

## Required output after each change

When using this skill, structure your response with:

1. **Route impact** — Which endpoints changed? New, modified, or removed?
2. **UI impact** — Does any JS call site need updating? Will the response shape change?
3. **Provider impact** — Does this affect model routing or tool dispatch?
4. **Flask/FastAPI parity** — If you changed a Flask route, does the FastAPI equivalent need the same change?
5. **Verification steps** — How to confirm the change works.

---

## Pre-patch checklist

Before making changes:

- [ ] Identified the exact entry point (Flask blueprint or FastAPI router).
- [ ] Traced the request path from UI → route → core → response.
- [ ] Checked if the endpoint is called from `api-service.js`, `main.js`, `mcp.js`, `image-gen-v2.js`, or `index.html`.
- [ ] Confirmed the current SSE event names and response shapes used by the frontend.
- [ ] Checked for auto-search trigger patterns that may be affected.

## Post-patch checklist

After making changes:

- [ ] `pytest services/chatbot/tests/ -v` passes.
- [ ] `/chat/stream` still returns valid SSE events with correct event names.
- [ ] All JS fetch calls in `static/js/` and `templates/` still match backend route paths.
- [ ] Tool IDs in `index.html` still match what `core/tools.py` and `routes/stream.py` expect.
- [ ] If a Flask route changed, the FastAPI equivalent was reviewed (update or document the gap).
- [ ] If a new route was added, blueprint registration in `chatbot_main.py` is confirmed.
- [ ] If a response shape changed, `api-service.js` event parsing was updated.
- [ ] No image-pipeline or ComfyUI files were modified for a chatbot-only change.
